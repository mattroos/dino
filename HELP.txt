# Training images should be organized in a directory structure in which a root
# directory has class subdirectories, with images of that class in the relevant
# subdirectory (e.g., 1000 subdirectories for ImageNet ILSVRC). Because DINO
# training is self-supervised and does not use labels, all the images can be
# in a single subdirectory. The path passed to the --data_path argument should
# be that of the root directory, not the subdirectory that actually contains
# the images.

# For machine with single 8GB RTX2080 GPU, max batch size is ~24. Default set by FB is 64.
